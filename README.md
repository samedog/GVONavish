This is a translation of GVONavish (Japanese) for GAMA server since it has a little more functionality over GVONavi (mostly the route manager) maybe will add notes and other fucntions depending on my needs.


- Code update to 64bits is done, releases will be in 64bits from now on.
- Updates for Visual Studio 2019 and the Windows 10 SDK (10.0.19041.0) are completed.


As soon as nprotect let me play on my Windows 11 machine i'll start updating the code for c++17, look for the current map and fix any possible issues.
Also maybe i'll bring the funtionality i promised (notes) as soon as the C++17 update is done.

------------------------------ ORIGINAL README TRANLATED BELOW---------------------------------------


When the surveying skill is used, the tool reads the coordinates from it and displays the surroundings.
Updates for GVONavi (http://www003.upp.so-net.ne.jp/mimizu/) stopped, so we imitated the texture.


It will not work unless the survey coordinates are visible on the screen.
The map image is confirmed with 4096 horizontal 2048 pixels vertical.
Otherwise it is a pain because it is a painless request. Perhaps it will work if it is 2:1 (wishful observation) I think about requests etc. when I feel like being able to throw it to the problem tracker or twitter account which will be described later.

I am speeding up from ver1.2 with 3D graphics function, but it may not work if it is an old PC environment where 4096 x 2048 size texture can not be created.
In that case please use the old version.
It is because it is quite a handmade implementation, but there is no improvement plan.


Method of operation
· Right-click on the map to display the menu
· Click and drag to move display position
· Scale by mouse wheel (or +/- numeric keys)
· Always display on the whole surface with F1 key ON / OFF
